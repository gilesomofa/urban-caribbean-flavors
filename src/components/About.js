          Whether it be because of the sound of our Calypso, Soca, Reggae, or
          Pan music. Or the smell of Oxtail Stew, Callaloo, Fried Plantains,
          Arroz con Pollo, or Bacalao. Perhaps, the unmistakable lilts in our
          local variations of European languages, or one of our several creole
          languages that have developed over the hundreds of years in our
          colonial and cosmopolitan cultures. The people of the Caribbean
          Islands, from the Greater to the Lesser Antilles, have an unmistakable
          and shared character of resourcefulness, hard work and hospitality. We
          also know how to make time to enjoy life to its fullest. In spite of
          all the challenges that these islands and their inhabitants have
          endured for the last several hundred years and the ones that they face
          today, there is a sense of resilience, pride, and hope that will
          always be a part of the Caribbean Spirit. It is our intention to
          highlight this beautiful spirit as well as the natural treasures of
          our beloved islands here at Urban Caribbean Flavors.

          Apart from being inspired to share the beautiful culture of the
          Caribbean, we are poised to provide different services to the benefit
          of the residents, visitors, and local and international
          eco-entrepreneurs. We highlight and inspire the growing network of
          ecologically minded farmers, traditionalists, artesans, musicians,
          scholars, and businesses who operate in equitable, sustainable, and
          culturally responsive ways. We will be sharing the stories of these
          inspiring heros who champion valued principals of the Caribbean
          Character. It is our mission to amplify the outreach and success of
          these people and their projects.
