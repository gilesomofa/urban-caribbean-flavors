The inspiration for this project comes from my desire to create a useful tool for the people of the US Virgin Islands, my birthplace. This website and application consists of a blog and a social media platform. The blog will engage visitors, potential visitors, locals, and lovers of Caribbean Culture to engage visitors, potential visitors, locals, and lovers of Caribbean Culture. Also, it will serve to drive engagement in the network. The social media platform is designed to provide travelers and locals with realtime conditions and offerings available in the USVIs. Business owners will be able to have a business profile which will will include links to social media, website, menus, contact info, schedule, ratings, etc. Individuals will have an individual profile which includes, name, bio, hometown, interests(predetermined by developer). Eventual monetization from site will be gained by charging business entities a nominal fee to maintain there profiles. When site exposure, usage and platform buy-in grows, businesses with be charged to post events.  

The application will allow users to make posts including text inputs and jpg, allow users to comment on posts, message other members of network, create and highlight events in several categories: food/bev, music, community, family/chilren. A general event tab as well as other category tabs will be rendered on main Social media landing.
